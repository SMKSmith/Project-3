## Background
In this project, the objective was to determine trends in the dataset to discover which regions of the United States are more risky to drive and the time of the day should drivers be more cautious.  


## Technologies Used
* Flask API
* SQLite
* CSV file 
* Python 
* Jupyter notebook
* Pandas 
* Git Hub
* HTML/CSS


## Data source
* Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonbown/us-2020-traffic-accidents?resource=download&select=acc_19.csv)


## Description of Data Exploration
This project used information gathered from a dataset from Kaggle. 

## Data Analysis

### Which Region of the US has the worst drivers? 
The southern region had the most car accidents in 2019. 

### Does time influence the number of accidents?
Yes, there are clear indicators showing certain hours with a high rate of accidents. 

### Which Make gets into accidents more frequently? 
Ford vehicles were the top Make for accidents in 2019.

### What is the severity of damage and frequency of each region?
The most common severity in all four region was “Possible Injury”



## Limitations of the Dataset and Future Consideration
Limitations with the dataset that was used had several limitations. The analyzed data was from 2019 and only looked at U.S. car accidents. The collected data did not investigate every detail regarding the accidents. Within the data that was collected there was missing data such as make and time of day. Not all accidents that happen in the U.S. are reported. Finally, the population density across the regions is not evenly distributed.
